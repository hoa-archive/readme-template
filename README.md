<!--- About Section --->

## About
I created this project in an effort to create a reusable general template that can be used for a variety of projects. The purpose was to spend less time creating thorough and detailed READMEs and more time writing actual code. I built this with a mix of HTML and Markdown because this project also served as a way for me to familiarize myself with the Markdown syntax. I drew inspiration for the formatting and layout from researching and reading good READMEs.

### Features
* Collapsable and customizable table of contents with page navigation links
* A wide range of sections that can be tailored and adjusted to fit any project
* An extensive list of resources under [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) that can be referenced to further improve upon READMEs.

### Built With
